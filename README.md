# PyBer_Analysis
Module 5 challenge

## Overview of the analysis:

The project of Pyber is to drill down raw rideshare data from January to early May of 2019, provide a statisitcal summary that compared to each city type and finally showcase on graph for better visualization.

## Results:

#### - Total rides:
Analysis result has shown that total rides in urban area (1625 rides) are greatest among all 3 city types, suburban is second place of 625 total rides. The city type with lowest total rides is in rural area (125 rides).

#### - Total drivers:
  Similar findings are found for total drivers counts. City type with largest counts of drivers are urban (2405 drivers), followed by suburban with 490 drivers then rural (78 drivers).

#### - Total fares:
  Liklihood as total rides and divers counts occured on total fares in urban area ($39,854.38) higher than fares in suburban of $19,356.33 and in rural of $4,327.93.

#### - Average fare per ride:
  Unlike the above findings, rural drivers receives higher fare of $34.62 in avaerage per ride compared to drivers in suburban ($30.97 per ride) and urban ($24.53 per ride).

#### -Average fare per driver:
  Finally, similarily, it is found average fares ($55.49 per driver) that each driver receives in rural are higher than the other two city types, suburban ($39.50) and urban ($16.57)

## Summary:

Based on the analysis findings, we've realized a positive correlationship between counts of drivers, rides and total revenues in each city type; in contrast, average fares per ride and drivers are correlated negatively with total drivers and rides by city type. 
Therefore, here I conclude the following measures that could potentially attain revenue growth: 
#### 1. Promote utilizations by advertizing Pyber in suburban and rural area.
#### 2. Employ more Pyber drivers in suburban and rural. 
#### 3. Increase the fare base by high demand area.
